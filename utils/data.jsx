These challenges are largely fueled by poverty and lack of school fees. Supporting bright children to continue their education will help create a more productive nation. To improve the community’s economic status, we also aim to establish a vocational training center to equip people with knowledge and practical skills for a sustainable livelihood.",

Volunteers introduce local farmers to techniques that prevent soil erosion and share skills in organic farming to reduce the use of harmful chemicals. The project supports both livestock and crop farming. Participants may help with greenhouse construction, farm management, crop planting and maintenance (onions, maize, millet, etc.), and livestock improvement through artificial insemination. These initiatives provide farmers with practical knowledge to achieve sustainable agricultural development.",

Since a clean and green environment is essential to all, we focus on tree planting under the theme “Trees for a Better Community.” Trees will be planted in markets, schools, health facilities, and along riverbanks—especially River Nzoia, which often floods. These efforts will help prevent soil erosion during heavy rains. With the support of stakeholders, donors, and volunteers, the project will make a lasting impact.",

Their unmet basic needs often lower their self-esteem and affect school performance. Our surveys reveal that some children and families go for several days without food, leading to malnutrition, hunger-related deaths, or theft for survival. By establishing greenhouses, introducing kitchen gardens, and providing farm inputs, we can help these families grow food, improve nutrition, and break the cycle of poverty.",

Poverty, overcrowded living conditions, and limited knowledge about prevention methods further increase their risk. Our outreach has also revealed that stigma, discrimination, and poor access to testing and treatment remain major challenges. Through awareness programs and community support, we aim to reduce stigma and improve access to essential services for these populations.",

I would recommend Umoja Foundation Group in Kenya to all my friends, and I am already thinking about doing another project next year. I don’t have a single negative thing to say about my experience, and I’m sad to be leaving. The project exceeded all my expectations. On the weekends, we traveled to many places, and I made memories I will never forget.",

The communication before arrival was excellent, and the local team welcomed us warmly at the airport. We worked mainly with the women’s empowerment group, helping with daily activities and English lessons. It was touching to see how dedicated and hardworking everyone was. The accommodation was simple but comfortable enough, and the meals were always fresh and delicious. We also had the chance to visit a local market and take a short safari during the weekend, which was absolutely unforgettable.",

He answered all my questions and made me feel comfortable. Our familiarization made me feel at home. I enjoyed playing football with the children. Thanks for the great experience!

We recommend your organization to anyone interested in volunteering and will also consider working with you again in the near future. You did an excellent job in every part of the experience. At first, we had some concerns and reservations because of the little children, and we weren’t sure if they would fit in or enjoy the experience. But we really enjoyed working alongside other volunteer families we met. My family will cherish the memories of the people we met and the experiences we shared. It was one of the best decisions I ever made for my family.",

Many locals would stop on the street to chat, and everyone you met would say 'habari mzungu,' which always made me laugh. The accommodation was basic but suitable, with everyone having their own bed, and the food was delicious at every meal. The tap water wasn’t suitable to drink, so we had to spend some money on bottled water. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.",
